		<h1>Harry Potter Fansite</h1>
	
	<p> Welcome to a Harry Potter fansite. Since this is supposed to be my first website and my original geocities dumpsterfire of a first website no longer exists (and that's probably a good thing), but it is apparently somewhat <a href=http://www.oocities.org/the3broomstix/3broomstix.html>archived</a> (and that's probably a <em>bad</em> thing). Hopefully I have learned, and if not, hopefully I will learn.</p>
	<p>While we're on the subject, reasons why that site was awful include:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>It was 2003</li>
		<li>I was 14</li>
		<li>I was using a WYSIWYG</li>
		<li>I was using <em>GeoCities's</em> WYSIWYG</li>
		<li><strong>I was 14</strong></li>
	</ol>


	<h2>Hogwarts Houses</h2>
