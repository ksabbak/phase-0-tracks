You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id
   ...> JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id
   ...> ;
1|5|they have books here|1|6|6|mike|tarkington|1|odds n ends bookstore
2|3|they have guitars here|3|4|4|beyonce|knowles|3|guitar shop
3|1|still can't swim|4|2|2|marco|polo|4|swimming school


There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.
select businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment, users.first_name, users.last_name from reviews
   ...> JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id
   ...> JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id;
odds n ends bookstore|5|they have books here|mike|tarkington
guitar shop|3|they have guitars here|beyonce|knowles
swimming school|1|still can't swim|marco|polo


How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?
select businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment, users.first_name, users.last_name from reviews
   ...> JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id
   ...> JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id
   ...> WHERE businesses.name = "swimming school";
swimming school|1|still can't swim|marco|polo
