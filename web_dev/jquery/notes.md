1. Start with whatever pops up first from a google search like "jquery basics" - this will give me something of an idea of where to go from here and how to approach the rest of my time.
2. Skim through the JS and JQuery book I bought for this course. - give my eyes a break from the screen, plus get a solid idea how to use this resource in the future
3. Probably find the docs and skim through those. - never a bad idea

The above is subject to change once I know more about jquery and find more resources about it. 

Given the 2 hour time limit, testing will not be scheduled but will likely happen if I come up anything I am not 100% clear on and 10 to 15 minutes will be devoted to playing with any subtopic that I find super interesting. 

Breaks will not be scheduled due to the time limit, but are not totally discouraged depending on moral.
