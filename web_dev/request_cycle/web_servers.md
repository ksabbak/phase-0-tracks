_What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?_

	* So, it looks like one of the main design philosophies of Linux is Open Source. Meaning that anyone can use it, play with it, etc. with no promises that it's going to work 100% of the time, but hey, that's just something else you can play with and share.


In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

 	* VPSes are VMs run on a server somewhere that people can host their websites on. They're cheaper than regular "real" servers, but may be slower since multiple VPSes can run on the same machine. It also looks like it's a little more flexible and customizable than a "shared hosting" type deal, where you likely still share a physical server, but don't have access to a VM to customize things.


_Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?_

	* Running programs as the root user on a Linux system is like bowling without bumpers, but if your ball ends up in the gutter, something horribly wrong could happen like losing all your files or corrupting your machine to the point where you have to reload your whole OS.
