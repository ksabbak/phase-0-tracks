First of all, I would like to point out as a non-robot entity that this release is very vague and I'm not 100% sure what I'm supposed to be doing here, so let's see how this works?

-Press the button outside the elevator 
	-if more than one button is present press the top button if going up and bottom button if going down
-Wait until doors open
-Enter elevator when doors open (exiting humans be damned, you're a robot, they're squishy)
-If no buttons are visible in front of you, turn to face the wall on your right, do this until buttons are visible.
-Find the button that matches the number of the desired floor
-Push the button

(tbh I have no idea which floor button this robot should push either)
