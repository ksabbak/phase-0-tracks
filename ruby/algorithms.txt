First of all, I would like to point out as a non-robot entity that this release is very vague and I'm not 100% sure what I'm supposed to be doing here, so let's see how this works?

-Press the button outside the elevator 
	-if more than one button is present press the top button if going up and bottom button if going down
-Wait until doors open
-Enter elevator when doors open (exiting humans be damned, you're a robot, they're squishy)
-If no buttons are visible in front of you, turn to face the wall on your right, do this until buttons are visible.
-Find the button that matches the number of the desired floor
-Push the button

(tbh I have no idea which floor button this robot should push either)


MAKE TEA:

-Enter the kitchen
-Approach the counter on the east side of the kitchen, go to the south end of that counter.
-Plug in the electric kettle base to the wall outlet that protrudes from the wall (not the other one because that doesn't get sufficient power and I'm likely living in a giant fire hazard of an apartment)
-Remove the lid from the electric kettle
-Pick up the electric kettle
-Turn to face the south and approach the sink
-Turn flip down the water filter lever
-Lift up the faucet handle, moving it to the right
-Place the large opening of the kettle under the stream of water
-Remove the kettle from under the water stream once the water is an inch below the line inside the kettle labeled "Max"
-Push down on the faucet handle until no more water is coming out of the faucet.
-Take the kettle to the base (on the southern end of the east counter)
-Place it on the base.
-Replace the lid
-Flick down the only lever on the kettle
-Turn to face the sink again (south)
-Open the cabinet that is up and to the right
-On the middle shelf remove a mug, hold it
-Turn 180ยบ (face north)
-Walk to the bookshelf
-Remove a teabag from the box labeled "mint chocolate rooibos"
-Place the teabag in the mug
-Face east and walk to the souther end of the east counter
-Wait until the lever on the kettle has returned to its original position
-Pour the water from the kettle into the mug
-Wait 4-6 minutes
-Drink the tea.
