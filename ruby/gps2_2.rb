# Method to create a list
# input: string of items separated by spaces (example: "carrots apples cereal pizza")
# steps: 
  # turn the string into an array (using split)
  # set default quantity - default quantity is 1
  # print the list to the console (call the print method)
# output: hash where keys = food and values = quantity

# Method to add an item to a list
# input: list, item name, and optional quantity
# steps: add item name to list as key 
# 		 and quantity as value (set value to one if not provided)
# output: Maybe the updated hash? Not 100% needed.

# Method to remove an item from the list
# input: list, item name
# steps: delete the key from the hash
# output: Maybe the updated hash? 

# Method to update the quantity of an item
# input: list, item name, new quantity
# steps: update the corresponding value to the item key
# output: Maybe the updated hash?

# Method to print a list and make it look pretty
# input: list

# output: the string
